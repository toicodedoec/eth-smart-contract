# eth-smart-contract
Hello World example of Ethereum Smart Contract.

Before starting the project, we have to prepare platforms and dependencies as the below.

### Prerequisites

* MetaMask (Chrome Extension): to install Metamask, you just need to open your Chrome browser and go to link [MetaMask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en), and click **Add To Chrome**

* NodeJS 8+

* Git

* IDE (Sublime, Visual Studio, Vim ...)

### Setup the project

As you know, Ethereum Smart Contract use Solidity programing language. So we have to install the compiler called Solc.
```
$ npm install -g solc
```

We need a Ethereum Node for the deployment and test. So we can use TestRPC to emulate Ethereum.
```
$ npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc
```

We use truffle to build/deploy the project, so we install Truffle via NPM:
```
$ npm install -g truffle
```
